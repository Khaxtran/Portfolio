                <p>Hello! I'm Kha, a web developer from Australia and Vietnam. I left my home country since I was 16 and came to Australia to live and study until today.</p>
                <p>It can be said that Vietnam is the place where I was born and raised, but Australia is the place that gives me many opportunities to learn and exchange knowledge. One of the best examples is becoming a web developer!</p>
                <p>In my free time, I like to play sports such as basketball, football(soccer), and computer games. I also like to take my chances of winning big.</p>
                <p>
                    Fun fact! I've been programing for
                    <span id="time-container"><script src="./script.js"></script></span> days since 12/07/2020!
